    <h1>About Draw-String</h1>

    <p style="width: 60%">
        Draw-String is meant to mimic a meeting place white board. All users viewing the same drawing will see live updates as anyone manipulates the drawing.
        All drawings are saved for future use and/or manipulation. The app requires browsers > IE8 that support 'canvas'. It was built primarily to explore some of the newer technologies and tools.
    </p>

        <h3>App details</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>

                Socket.io for websocket management.
            </li>
            <li>
                The shapes/canvas are serialized to json and saved in the mongodb (via mongoose).
            </li>
            <li>
                The fabric.js shapes have been extended to allow for adding a unique id to each (created using mongodb._id).
